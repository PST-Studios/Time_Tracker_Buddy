# Time_Tracker_Buddy
Essentially a stop watch type program for timing tasks.

This program was meant to be used as a time management application for tasks.  I have not touched it in a while but I will be taking this on to get it finished shortly.  The end goal is to be able to select or add a task, highlight the task, start the tracker, and time how long you've been doing the task, stop the timer, and save the results for later viewing.  I also forgot to put the export feature in here.  

I might eventually reduce this to a web app or melt it into my portal web app.  Not entirely sure yet, but it will get messed with soon so keep checking back if you have any use for this.

Feel free to edit or do whatever to the code to fit you needs.  It's very simple to make and to understand/modify.  I am not responsible for anything related to this.
